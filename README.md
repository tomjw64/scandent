# scandent

Parser for an xml/html selection language that I wish existed as an alternative to xpath and css.

The only thing that actually processes and evaluates scandent on an xml document is [replicator](https://github.com/tomjw64/replicator), which is an xml transformation tool.


See the tests included in lib.rs for examples of what scandent looks like
